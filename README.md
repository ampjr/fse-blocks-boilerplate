# Amp-jr's fse-blocks-boilerplate

## Overview

This is a boilerplate theme with full-site editing (FSE) and slider block for WordPress.

Rather than having random bits of code, I thought it would be best to showcase the various requirements by rolling them all into a starter theme. Just download, install, & activate. Enjoy!

## Approach

- **index.html**: The main template file for WordPress FSE. Plus a few others to get you started building.

- **footer.html**: uses JS to display the current date.

- **/css/**: has all of the themes styles, Foundation for responsive layout, and a few animations.

- **gulpfile.js**: to build/compile SASS.

- **functions.php**: Enques styles,scripts, and blocks. 1 function to remove the WP version. 1 function to add a meta description tag.

- **/blocks/**: contains everything for a custom starter slider block using Swiper.
